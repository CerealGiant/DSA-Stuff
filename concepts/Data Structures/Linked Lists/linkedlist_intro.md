# Linked List Intro

## Difference between linked list and array:

- An aray occupies linear memory. All the elements in the array are located in memory locations adjacent to each other.

- In a linked list, when you add a new element, it will be stored in a completely different memory location. Hence, we need to also store the order of when new elements are added. 

- To do this, we will store the address of the next element along with the current element in a datatype called node(user-defined).

## How a linked list works

- The linked list starts with the head, which stores the address of the first element in the linked list. Each subsequent element(node) contains data and the address of the next element.

- If we are storing integers, node will contain 2 datatypes, one an int and the other int*.

- Thus, a linked list is a collection of nodes that store data.

## Operations in a linked list

- Deletion
