# Graph Algorithms

## What is a graph?

A graph consists of vertices and edges.

## Why use graphs?

- Graphs are very useful in problem solving.
- We see graph questions in various competitions and challenges.
- Graphs can also be used to solve a lot of real life problems.

### Applications of Graphs in real world problem

#### 01 Shortest Path in Google Maps

- In this case, landmarks/cities will be represented using vertices.
- The roads/flights to travel from one landmark/city to another will be the edge.

#### 02 Social Networking Sites

- Vertices will be people
- Edges will be the connections between people

In this scenario, a graph data structure will be beneficial in generating news feeds and finding mutual friends.

#### 03 Circuit Design

- If we want to find the minimum length of wire that supplies current to all the "nodes" and completes the circuit

- Vertices will be the resistors
- Edges will be the wire

#### 04 Routing Algorithms

- Vertices will be the routers across the globes
- Edge will be the time taken for packets to flow

#### 05 Delivery Routes for vans

- Vertices will be the destinations 
- Edges will be the routes.

#### 06 Resolving Dependencies

- Vertices will be API Calls/Software Dependencies
- Edges will be dependencies between tasks (this is solved using an algorithm called **topological sorting**)

#### 07 Graphs in Deep Learning

- Vertices will be Neurons
- Edges will be connections between them

#### 08 Web Document (DOM Tree)

- Vertices be Dom elements
- Edges will be connections 

#### 09 Image Processing and Segmentation

- Vertices will be pixels
- Edges will be connections between neighbouring pixels.

#### 10 Image Processing and Segmentation

- Vertices will be pixels
- Edges will be connections between neighbouring pixels.
